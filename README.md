# tetris-99-scoreboard

**A scoreboard for streamers of Tetris 99**

Make an "output" folder, then run the program and edit the Name and various stat fields. Looking in the output folder, you'll see a currentplayer.txt file (as well as one for each player configured). Point an OBS Text Source at the currentplayer.txt file will continuously update as the stats in the window are updated; that way you can position and style the text however you want.

This is a very quickly-made experiment to play around with Electron; hit up @mrasmus if you want more information. Better docus probably coming.
